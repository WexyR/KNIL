# KNIL

KNIL is a french linux console RPG I've done with a schoolmate for a school project.

You are the new hero of a town where cityzen need your help and send you look for items in the dungeon just aside the town.

All the quests, dialogs, NPCs, and map contents are discribed in xml data files. Therefore, they can be easily modified to make your own console RPG.
